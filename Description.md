Transitioning from the the educational world to the corporate one can be difficult in any field. Luckily, the computer science classroom presents a unique opportunity to provide students with real-world experiences that prepare them for careers in the tech industry. With the availability of open source technologies, students in high school can participate in a very close approximation to the day-to-day work of software professionals. Through engaging, student-driven projects, students can learn by doing, and come away with the technical and social acumen to enter the workforce successfully.

In this session, we will explore a variety of project options and processes that lead teams of students to success, and effectively equip them with the skills they need to begin careers in software. With this broad, project-based approach, students can be exposed to all areas of the software industry, including programming, user experience, quality assurance, software development methodology, project management, full-stack web development, version control, collaboration, communication, application deployment, and tooling.

We will discuss topics like the balance between guidance and autonomy, industry trends and skills-in-need, best practices for mentorship, the importance of pair programming (and even mob programming), the joy of creativity, and more. By leveraging these techniques, your students can become legitimate software developers before they're even out of high school!
